 1. 2D Euclidean geometry arises from projective geometry by singling out first a line at infinity and subsequently, two points called circular points lying on this line.
 2. 3D Euclidean space to be derived from
projective space by singling out a particular plane as the plane at infinity and specifying a particular conic lying in this plane to be the absolute conic.
